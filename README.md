ðŸš¨ Introducing India SOS: Your Emergency Companion ðŸš¨

In times of emergency, every second counts. That's why Iâ€™m excited to share the launch of India SOS, an Android app designed to be your go-to companion in urgent situations.

ðŸ”¹ One-Tap Emergency Contacts: Instantly connect with various emergency services such as police, ambulance, and fire departments across India.

ðŸ”¹ Add Personal Emergency Contacts: Easily store and access your trusted contacts so they can be notified in case of an emergency.

ðŸ”¹ User-Friendly Interface: Intuitive design to ensure help is just a tap away, no matter the situation.

ðŸ”¹ Quick and Reliable: Speed and reliability are at the core of this app, ensuring you have access to the help you need, when you need it the most.

This project is close to my heart as it aims to enhance personal safety and provide peace of mind in critical moments. Feel free to check it out, and Iâ€™d love to hear your feedback!
